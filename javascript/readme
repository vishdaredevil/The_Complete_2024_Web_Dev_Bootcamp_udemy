JavaScript Learning folder
This folder showcases my hands-on learning and practice in JavaScript. 
It includes fundamental concepts, intermediate-level programming, DOM manipulation, and small projects to reinforce learning.
Through this journey, Iâ€™m building a solid understanding of modern JavaScript features (ES6+), event handling, and interactive web development. 
The files and folders in this repo reflect the progression of my skills and projects as I explore JavaScript in greater depth.
